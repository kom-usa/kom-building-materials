/**
 * The 3D kitchen planner, and how screwthemiddleman.com points at it.
 *
 * Jordan built it — `kom-usa/KOM-3D-Kitchen-Designer`. It is **not** a Next app
 * this repo can host: the toolchain is `vinext` with an `.openai/hosting.json`
 * binding a D1 `DB`, so it runs as a ChatGPT Site. Porting it onto this stack
 * is a rebuild, not a deploy, and that is a later decision.
 *
 * ✅ **LIVE since 11 Sep**, and on the **KOM workspace** rather than the personal
 * account everyone planned around: `kom-usa-0158.chatgpt.site`, not
 * `jpetrovich290.chatgpt.site`. Michael approved publication and Jordan
 * published it. Verified by three signed-out requests returning 200 with the
 * title `KOM 3D Kitchen & Material Designer`; the old personal URL was still
 * returning 401 minutes earlier, so the two are different Sites.
 *
 * **This site keeps BOTH tools** (Ovidiu, 11 Sep). The quick material estimate
 * is for a customer who knows the products and sizes they need; the 3D planner
 * is for one who needs help with the layout. The planner does not replace it.
 *
 * ⚠️ **`BLUEPRINT.md` §7 says "One universal project builder."** Offering a
 * second way in is a deliberate departure from that line, not an oversight.
 *
 * ⚠️ **THE TWO PATHS DO NOT SHARE A QUOTE INTAKE, and now that the planner is
 * live that is a real risk rather than a theoretical one.** The estimator on
 * `/project-builder` writes its total to `localStorage`, sends the customer to
 * `/contact`, and submits through Netlify Forms. The planner writes its request
 * to its own D1 `quote_requests` table and only forwards it when
 * `QUOTE_AUTOMATION_WEBHOOK_URL` is set — unset, the customer sees a
 * confirmation while the lead sits in a table nobody opens. **No copy on this
 * site may claim the two paths meet**, and none does: the sentence "Both paths
 * lead to one official quote request reviewed by the KOM team" was specified
 * for the hub and deliberately NOT shipped, because it is not true yet.
