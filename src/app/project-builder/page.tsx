 * Two ways to start, then the estimator.
 *
 * **This page stopped being "the estimator" on 11 Sep.** It carries two tools
 * now, so the top has to let a customer choose between them before either one
 * starts asking for input. The choice is framed by what they already know —
 * layout help, or products and sizes — because that is the thing a customer can
 * answer about themselves without knowing anything about our software.
 *
 * ⚠️ **The 3D planner is a card, not an advertisement.** It spent a few hours
 * as a full-width promotional block above the estimator, which read as though
 * the estimator were the fallback. Two equal cards say what is true: two
 * starting points, neither a consolation prize.
 *
 * ⚠️ **"Both paths lead to one official quote request" is NOT on this page**,
 * though it was specified for it. It is not true yet: the estimator submits
 * through the contact form to Netlify, and the planner writes to its own
 * database and forwards only if a webhook is configured. See `data/designer.ts`.
 * Ship that sentence when the intakes actually meet, not before.
